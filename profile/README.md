# Welcome to the Developer Club! ðŸ™Œ
This Github Organization have all the In-House projects for Lead Developers to contribute to and "open-source" projects for all Developer Club members to contribute to.

## Current Teams
- App: Khang (Head), Jordan
- Web: Julio (Head), Shaga, Benwin, Arriza
- AI/ML: Anirudh (Head), Shivaram
- Game: Pierce (Head)
- System: Shaga (Head)
- Hackathon: Cody (Head), Anirudh (*They have a seperate organization page, current rationale is they'll be clouding the repositories with partially-developed repos due to the nature of Hackathons. Ask Hackathon Head Dev to be added to the org and start competing.*)
